<h1>How to run project</h1>

<p>
    First of all you need to install requirements.
    <br/>
    Please run: pip install -r requirements.txt in root of project to install below package:
<ul>
    <li>django: Web framework i used for this project</li>
</ul>

If you want to use any dbms except sqlite please find approprate package from optional-requirements.txt and install it with pip.
Then in Question1/settions.py uncomment suitable DATABASE definition. For example for mysql you should uncomment:

<div class="code">
    'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
    'NAME': 'FataDB',
    'USER': 'account_problem',
    'PASSWORD': '‫‪tnuocca‬‬',
    'HOST': '127.0.0.1'
    }
</div>

Then you need to generate database tabls. Please run code below command in the root of project:
<div class="code">
    python manage.py syncdb
</div>
This command generates tables and indexes from models in database.
Then you need to run web server. You can run it with below command in the root of project:
<div class="code">
    python manage.py runserver
</div>

After running web server you can test application, following links could help you to do it:
<ul>
    <li>"/" is login form</li>
    <li>"/register" is register form</li>
    <li>"/activate" is activation form</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Different Modules
</h2>

<h3>
    user_management.models
</h3>

<p>
    User domain model is in this module, User is a django model so we will have a table relevant to it. <br/>
    The user password will hash by set_password method so for setting password you need to call set_password instead of setting
    password directly. Don't forget this note because if you set it directly it won't work. the other public methods use by services
    and you don't need to use them directly
</p>

<h3>
    user_management.user_manager
</h3>

<p>
    Required services are in this module and you can use them to work with account management system.
<ul>
    <li>
        register_user function: You should pass a Use object, captcha code and session object to this function.
            As the name is clear this function will register user in system.
            If captcha is not valid you will get  CaptchaException exception.
            If user exist you will get : UserAlreadyExistException exception.
            If user information is not ok ( for examample email is wrong ) you will get a ValidationException exception.
        If user registered system will send activation_code to user email.
    </li>
    <li>
        authenticate function: You should pass username and password to this function.
        function will authenticate user.
        if User is not active you will get UserInActiveException expcetion
        if User does not exist you will get None object
        if authentication is correct you will get User object.
    </li>
    <li>
        activate function: You should pass an activation code to this function.
        If activation code is for a user who is not active currently, his user will activate.
        If User account was activated before, a UserActivationExpired exception will raise.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>

    send_mail is in this module.

<h3>
    exceptions
</h3>

<h2>
    Security Notes:
</h2>
<p>
    Every post form has a csrf token. So CSRF attack is not possible.
    All queries are created with an ORM so Sql Injection is not possible.
    For sniffing we can use SSL/TLS for transport protocol easily.
    All passwords are hashed so sniffing between web server and dbms is not a case.
